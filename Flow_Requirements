Camera Video Streaming through Kafka and Spark Stream


The whole task is implemented on Linux platform
Before running the code make sure to start zookeeper(local) and then the kafka broker server(local)



then start the kafka producer (kproducer) with topic jbm.

Collect the images that get stored in the destination path with face recognised using AdaBoost (pre-trained) model.

END to END:
WebCam Video face detection using AdaBoost model and streaming that video through kafka where spark stream collects and saves the face detected images to the desired location

Here first we setup the whole producer side confguration(buffer size,aknowledges, Message type, retries, batch size , zookeeper servers etc.) for kafka brokers
Then we take snaps and detect faces using pre-trained AdaBoost(Decision tree based supervised boosting algorithm) model(done in openCV).
Serlialize it to json using google's gson lib and sending the json string over kafka (topic:jbm) 
Create a consumer which subscribers to jbm topic and deserialize json string to SnapStream object which gets collected in Spark's(local i.e single node) DataSet
get it partitioned for the required block size (user_input) (Stream.java or Stream2.java)
Iterate through DataSet and get the Mat function from SnapStream object and save those at required location.
